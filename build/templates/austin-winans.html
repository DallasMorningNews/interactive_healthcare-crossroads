    <p>Random calculations on slivers of paper could be found everywhere last fall in the Plano home of Austin and Leigh Winans. </p>
    <p>It’s not that they are mathematicians.</p>
    <p>Austin’s a real estate agent and Leigh a part-time administrative assistant. But shopping for health insurance proved as challenging as differential calculus.</p>
    <p>“Nightly we’d be like, ‘Have you looked at this plan and compared it to that plan?’” recalled Austin. Conversations about health insurance would run well past dinner. </p>
    <p>The end tables in the bedroom and the granite countertops of the kitchen became peppered with envelopes and paper towels that had half-finished equations scribbled all over them. </p>

    <div class="video-block video-block-MwNWl1YTE6UJMIImITb6DeR76YtVMuPi">
      <div class="video-wrapper">

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Every time they thought they made a decision, they’d come to a wrinkle — like a too high deductible or a preferred doctor being out of network.</p>
    <p>“We’d go back to the drawing board,” Austin said.</p>
    <p>“It was a very frustrating process,” added Leigh.</p>
    <p>Several health insurers decided to stop selling plans on the marketplace for Texas last year. At the time, federal health officials vowed that consumers would have plenty of low-cost options to choose from. </p>
    <p>But cost was only one factor to consider. Each year, the plans sold changed significantly. The couple would be forced to sort out which physicians, hospitals and prescriptions would now be in-network. </p>
    <p>Coverage concerns were different for each member of the family, so a single plan did not work for Austin, who has Type 1 diabetes, Leigh and their now 18-month old daughter, Ellie Grace. </p>
    <p>President Barack Obama’s promise at the onset of the Affordable Care Act — that “If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period” — did not seem to be holding true.</p>
    <p>Austin grew frustrated when plans that allowed him to keep his endocrinologist failed to also cover the medications that work best for him. Likewise, Leigh found policies that were in-network for their favorite obstetrician, but out-of-network for their preferred pediatrician. </p>

      <h6>Tell us your story</h6>
      <p>Reporters from <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> want to learn how the Trump administration’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act affects Texans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">We need your help.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>“You should be able to take any insurance, to any doctor, and be satisfied,” Leigh said.</p>
    <p>Ultimately it took three weeks, plus the assistance of Take Command Health, a Dallas-based startup that helps people shop for health plans, before the couple decided.</p>
    <p>The family does not qualify for subsidies to help offset costs. </p>
    <p>Leigh opted for a faith-based health care ministry called Medi-Share, an alternative to insurance that has attracted a growing number of Christians. Members contribute to each other’s medical expenses and must follow certain lifestyle principles.</p>
    <p>At $240 a month, it’s about $500 less than the best option to cover her and Ellie Grace on the exchange. But it does not cover Ellie Grace’s immunizations, so the couple identified pharmacies and clinics that offer them at reasonable rates.</p>
    <p>Medi-Share also does not accept people with pre-existing conditions. So Austin purchased an HMO from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas on the marketplace for about $400 a month. Altogether, the couple will need to pay $5,500 in out-of-pocket expenses in 2017 before they reach their deductibles for the year.</p>
    <p>And despite all their careful planning, the couple found out during a pre-scheduled appointment in February that Austin’s doctors are temporarily not on the Blue Cross network. “I finally found an endocrinologist that I like. And now I still may have to switch,” Austin said.</p>
    <p>The couple voted in 2016 for Donald Trump, who campaigned on replacing the ACA. Still, a new plan might require yet another recalculation by the family.</p>
    <p>“Anything new, we’re looking forward to,” Austin said. “But at the same time we’re unsure what it might bring,” Leigh added.</p>

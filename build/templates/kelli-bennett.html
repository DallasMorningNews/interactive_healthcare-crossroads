    <p>When a clear, pocket-sized device in the front of Kelli Bennet’s blue jean overalls began to beep, she leapt from the table, mid-sentence, and grabbed a sack of medications from the countertop. </p>
    <p>The device warned that at 250 mg/dL, her blood sugar had spiked to more than 100 milligrams per deciliter above the normal range. </p>
    <p>Another major jump could potentially leave her in a coma, or dead. </p>
    <p>The alert allowed her to quickly intervene, before she began to feel “pukey, tired and thirsty.” </p>
    <p>After struggling for years to control her Type 1 diabetes, three years ago Bennett was finally able to afford $9,000 worth of new technology that helps regulate her blood sugar and keep her alive. </p>
    <p>For the 37-year-old Flower Mound resident, the technology means freedom. </p>
    <p>Freedom from constant worry. Freedom to work again. Freedom to live a normal life.</p>

      </div>
    </div>


    <p>And it was all possible because of the Affordable Care Act, which allowed her to purchase health insurance that covered the treatment. After her diagnosis at age 22, Bennett had been forced into a high-risk pool, where insurance only paid for enough insulin to make life tolerable — but just barely.</p>
    <p>So on Election Night, as Bennett sat glued to the television at her parents’ North Texas home, she could see all of her freedom slipping away. Votes mounted for Donald Trump — the candidate who had vowed to take away the very thing that had dramatically improved her quality of life. </p>
    <p>Her entire body tensed as she thought back to that night. Dissolving into tears, she curled her hands into tight fists — her despair tinged with anger over the political rhetoric that continues to hold her life in the balance. </p>
    <p>Politicians are set on “doing something different than Obamacare.” The conversations, she said, rarely seem to focus on the millions like her — the people the ACA helped.</p>
    <p>Bennett’s story shows the difficulty of insuring people with chronic conditions. </p>

      <h6>Tell us your story</h6>
      <p>Reporters from <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> want to learn how the Trump administration’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act affects Texans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">We need your help.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>The non-discrimination clause in the Obama-era law meant that health insurers could no longer offer barebones plans. In 2013, Bennett purchased a policy on the federal marketplace that qualified her for devices that automate the monitoring and adjusting of blood sugar. Doing it manually used to disrupt her day and frustrate those who had to pick up her workload.</p>
    <p>With levels more controlled, she started her own dog-walking business, which now has over 20 clients and earns about $25,000 a year. She lives with her parents as she continues to grow the business.</p>
    <p>Bennett admits that things aren’t perfect. The monthly cost of her health plan doubled to $500 in 2017. She doesn’t qualify for a subsidy to help pay the premiums because she lives at home. If premiums continue to increase, costs alone may force her out of the market. </p>
    <p>Still, she frets that Republicans will remove the mandate that requires healthy people to either purchase health insurance or pay a fine. The fewer people in the pool, the higher the costs and the more likely she will be forced back into a gutted plan that doesn’t cover what she needs.</p>
    <p>When initial efforts to replace the ACA collapsed in March, Bennett could feel only tempered relief. </p>
    <p>“They could still do a lot of damage. And I can’t prepare, since I don’t know what’s coming.”</p>
    <p>Now that life is markedly better, Bennett is terrified of going backward. “I would rather have never had good insurance than to know what freedom is like and lose it,” she says. </p>
    <p>“For me it’s pay or die.”</p>

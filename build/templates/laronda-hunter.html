    <p>LaRonda Hunter has run the numbers.</p>
    <p>Providing health insurance for employees at the five Fantastic Sams salons she owns could cost more than $200,000. And though the business has been successful, there’s just no way she can afford it.</p>
    <p>“It could put me out of business,” said Hunter, 57.</p>
    <p>The Fort Worth woman once worked as an accountant at American Airlines. After 14 years, she wanted a lifestyle change. One option was becoming a franchisee. She had a good credit score and enough money, so in 2006, she bought her first salon in Saginaw.</p>
    <p>Choosing the value hair salon business was a calculated risk. She figured it was recession-proof — that people would always need to get their hair done. When the 2008 recession hit, Hunter was proved right. By 2015, her Fort Worth business had grown from one franchise to five.</p>

    <p>But expansion has stalled ever since.</p>
    <p>That’s because of a mandate in the Affordable Care Act stating that business owners must provide health insurance if they employ 50 workers or more, or pay a penalty of $2,000 per employee.</p>
    <p>Profit margins in her industry are too slim for either option. So instead, Hunter keeps a close eye on her payroll, maintaining between 45 and 49 full-time employees, which the law defines as anyone working more than 30 hours a week.</p>
    <p>Hunter pays herself a five-figure salary. In 11 years, the single mother of one has found success as an entrepreneur and once envisioned owning 10 salons.</p>
    <p>Now, she’s stuck.</p>
    <p>Hunter genuinely wants to know what a business owner like her is supposed to do. That’s how she ended up on CNN this past February, posing a question to Sen. Bernie Sanders in a televised debate.</p>
    <p>“How do I employ more Americans without either raising the prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?” she asked Sanders.</p>

      <h6>Tell us your story</h6>
      <p>Reporters from <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> want to learn how the Trump administration’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act affects Texans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">We need your help.</a></p>

    <p>Sanders simply told her that she needs to provide insurance if she employs 50 or more workers without answering the “how.”</p>
    <p>That’s one reason she voted for Donald Trump. The president’s promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would allow her to expand her business once again.</p>
    <p>“It needs to be laid out more based on the business’s profitability, or profit margin, vs. 50 employees,” Hunter said. “There needs to be more things that are involved in determining how a business should contribute.”</p>
    <p>Hunter said she might offer health insurance if she could pay for a smaller portion. Currently, the mandate says employees can’t pay more than 9.5 percent of their wages toward health insurance.</p>
    <p>Hunter understands her employees want it, but right now, prices are too high. This year, for the first time in her life, she did not buy her own health insurance after her monthly premiums under the ACA increased by more than $500.</p>
    <p>“I personally don’t think that employers should have the responsibility of taking care of everybody,” Hunter said. “I don’t think the government should, either. We all should take some responsibility for ourselves.”</p>

      <p>When a small device in Kelli Bennett’s front pocket began to beep, she leapt from the table mid-sentence and grabbed a sack of medications.</p>

      <p>The device warned that her blood sugar had dangerously spiked. Another major jump could potentially leave her in a coma, or dead. </p>

      <p>After struggling for years to control her Type 1 diabetes, three years ago Bennett was finally able to afford a $9,000 bionic pancreas -- a new technology that helps regulate her blood sugar.</p>

      <p>And it was all possible because of the Affordable Care Act, which allowed her to purchase health insurance that covered the treatment. Since her diagnosis at age 22, Bennett had been forced into a high-risk pool, where insurance only paid for enough insulin to make life tolerable -- but just barely.</p>

      <p>For the 37-year-old Flower Mound resident, the technology means freedom. Freedom from constant worry. Freedom to work again. Freedom to live a normal life.</p>

      <p>So on Election Night, as Bennett sat glued to the television at her parents’ North Texas home, she could see all of her freedom slipping away. Votes mounted for Donald Trump -- the candidate who had vowed to take away the very thing that had dramatically improved her quality of life. </p>

      {% include "adblock1.html" %}

      <p>“I would rather have never had good insurance than to know what freedom is like and lose it,” she said. </p>

      <p>Dissolving into tears, she curled her hands into tight fists -- her despair tinged with anger over the political debate that holds her life in the balance. </p>

      <p>Politicians are set on “doing something different than Obamacare,” she said. But their conversations rarely focus on the millions like her -- the people the ACA helped.</p>

      <p>Bennett’s story shows the difficulty of insuring people with chronic conditions. </p>

      <p>The non-discrimination clause in the Obamacare law meant that health insurers could no longer deem her “uninsurable” or offer bare-bones plans. In 2013, Bennett purchased a policy on the federal marketplace that qualified her for devices that automate the monitoring of her blood sugar. </p>

      <p>Now, she has started her own dog-walking business, which now has over 20 clients and earns about $25,000 a year. </p>

      <p>Bennett admits that Obamacare isn’t perfect. The monthly cost of her health plan doubled to $500 in 2017. She doesn’t qualify for a subsidy to help pay the premiums because she lives with her parents. If premiums continue to increase, costs alone may force her out of the market. </p>

      <p>Still, she frets that Republicans will remove the mandate that requires healthy people to either purchase health or pay a fine. The fewer people in the insurance pool, the higher the costs and the more likely she will be forced back into a high-risk pool, paying thousands for minimal coverage.</p>

      <p>Even so, she knows she has to have insurance.</p>

      <p>“For me it’s pay, or die.”</p>

    <p>Nicole Antoine and her husband, Mike, watched from lawn chairs as their three daughters played volleyball in the backyard of their rented Grand Prairie home. </p>
    <p>The girls — ages 12, 7 and 3 — erupted in laughter as the ball soared off course, flying toward a nearby tree. </p>
    <p>Three-month-old Margo, the most recent addition, slept soundly in her father’s arms. </p>
    <p> The family is the picture of health. And for that reason, the Antoines made a crucial decision three years ago. They chose to drop health insurance coverage for a time, and to pay the penalty that the Affordable Care Act imposes instead.</p>
    <p> The cheery backyard scene belied the anxiety the couple often feels about their future. “Things are tight,” admitted Nicole, a part-time pharmacy technician who says she’s always been good at budgeting. </p>
    <p> The family had an Obamacare plan, but when premiums shot up to $5,000 a year, it no longer made sense. “When it became unaffordable, we had to opt out,” Nicole said.</p>

    <!-- video goes here -->
    <p>It’s a predicament faced by many young and healthy people, who are required by law to purchase health insurance. The goal is to increase their presence on the marketplace; the bigger the pool, the lower the costs for everyone.</p>
    <p>Things didn’t necessarily go as planned. While uninsured rates have dropped significantly, many of the people who initially flooded into the exchanges had chronic conditions. Many had been denied coverage for years and felt life-saving treatments were out of reach. Costs continued to rise, year after year.</p>
    <p>Families like the Antoines felt the impact. </p>
    <p> They long to be homeowners, to have a piece of the American dream that inspired their parents to emigrate from the Caribbean decades ago. But with rents skyrocketing in Texas, plus clothes and food for their growing family, it’s been difficult to save for a down payment.</p>
    <p> Monthly insurance premiums felt like money down the drain. Even more, the deductible was “unrealistic,” making the mandatory coverage worthless. </p>

      <h6>Tell us your story</h6>
      <p>Reporters from <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> want to learn how the Trump administration’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act affects Texans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">We need your help.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>“[The law] forced me to continually pay for something that I don’t need,” Nicole said. “If you need it, you need it. If you don’t, you don’t. And we really don’t get sick that often.” </p>
    <p> Her children could get vaccines and flu shots from clinics for cheaper. Until Mike started a new full-time job last year as a truck driver, the family’s low income allowed the girls to be covered by Medicaid for more serious concerns. Nicole and her husband rarely needed to see a doctor.</p>
    <p> Mike’s new job comes with health insurance benefits. The costs are manageable, at only a few hundred dollars more per year than the annual fine that the Internal Revenue Service charges for families their size that remain uninsured.</p>
    <p>Still, if the insurance mandate were eliminated, the couple — whose combined income is just over $50,000 a year — say they’d consider dropping employer-sponsored coverage too, in order to save money and pay off debts.</p>
    <p>“When I heard repeal and replace I was like ‘OK, can I get my penalty money back?’” said Nicole. She was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy and said several people unfriended her on Facebook for expressing her views. </p>
    <p>She wanted change. Specifically, on policies like health care that did not work for her family. “If it’s supposed to be helping me, it should be affordable, which it was not,” she said. </p>
    <p>When asked what would happen if someone in her family got sick while uninsured, Nicole points out that even people with coverage get slammed with surprise medical bills.</p>
    <p>“We can’t always expect that we’ll be the epitome of health,” she said. “But I’d rather cross that bridge when I get to it.”</p>

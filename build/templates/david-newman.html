    <p>Dave Newman had two heart attacks before age 40. </p>
    <p>A long scar down the center of his chest serves as a daily reminder. But it’s not like he could ever forget. </p>
    <p>For years, the self-employed real estate agent was constantly reminded of his heart issues as he tried to deal with health insurance companies.</p>
    <p>“They all said the same thing: ‘You’re uninsurable,’” the 56-year-old Flower Mound resident recalled. </p>
    <p>He knew that finding a plan might be costly. He also figured he’d have to shop around. But to be deemed completely “uninsurable” was a shock. After several attempts, he gave up and went for years without any type of coverage. Instead, he relied on free biannual screenings at the local public hospital, all the while living in fear of his next health care crisis.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a matter of if I’ll have another heart attack, it’s when,” he said. </p>

    <p>He finally purchased health insurance, for the first time in about a decade, after federal marketplaces set up through the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2013. Currently, he pays about $150 a month after a subsidy, and meeting the $3,500 deductible is easy given the 14 prescriptions and 13 supplements he takes daily for his heart. </p>
    <p>He says he has also been able to get additional procedures while insured, including the placement of a stent, defibrillator and pacemaker. </p>
    <p>It was never his plan to go without insurance.</p>
    <p>When he had his heart attacks, he worked full time, and company-sponsored health coverage paid for the bulk of his $140,000 quadruple bypass surgery.</p>
    <p>As his mother grew older, however, Newman needed a flexible work schedule to be her caregiver. He left his job in guest relations with TGI Fridays and started working in real estate, not imagining the move would completely close him off from the insurance market.</p>
    <p>The dependence on full-time employment for health insurance is a problem the Affordable Care Act aimed to address. </p>

      <h6>Tell us your story</h6>
      <p>Reporters from <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> want to learn how the Trump administration’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act affects Texans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">We need your help.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>Self-employed Individuals like Newman often found themselves navigating the murky waters of health coverage alone, with no company or group to negotiate lower rates on their behalf. </p>
    <p>The law barred insurers on the exchange from excluding people with pre-existing conditions, like Newman. </p>
    <p>That rule remains one of the most popular parts of the ACA, and Republicans have vowed to keep it. The law also offered subsidies to individuals who earned too little to pay for coverage and created a marketplace where insurers could compete for paying customers, keeping costs low for all.</p>
    <p>But even before the 2016 election, insurers had been backing out. Consumers were left with fewer choices and soaring premiums for health care plans. And now that President Donald Trump has vowed to replace Obamacare, it remains to be seen whether insurers will simply get out of the marketplaces altogether.</p>
    <p>That’s what worrying Newman now.</p>
    <p>Working independently no longer seems sustainable or necessary after his mom passed away in December.</p>
    <p>So he’s looking for jobs in customer service and administrative support, and considering only companies that offer health insurance benefits to full-time staff.</p>
    <p>“Hopefully I can avoid some of the chaos,” he said, thinking ahead to open enrollment. His main focus is on state and federal government jobs, “which always seem to have the best benefits.”</p>
    <p>As he sifts through job boards and seeks out leads, he knows he’s racing against a clock. If the ACA marketplaces implode or the law gets repealed before he can get a job with benefits, he’ll be back to bargaining with insurance companies for coverage. But he says going without it is not an option.</p>
    <p>“I would literally be dead without health insurance.”</p>

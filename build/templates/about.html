    <h4>About this project</h4>

		<p class="about__intro">Staff writers Sabriya Rice and Brendan Meyer are exploring the effects of health care policy changes on ordinary Americans. They have spent months talking to area residents about their concerns about the costs and quality of health insurance. We plan to continue the discussion throughout the year as the policy debate continues. We want to keep the focus on you and your stories. Check back for updates and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">share your experiences here</a>.</p>

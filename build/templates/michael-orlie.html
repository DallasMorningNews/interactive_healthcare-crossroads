    <p>The sun reflected off Michael Orlie’s 1967 Porsche 912 in his Arlington driveway.</p>
    <p>He bought it four years ago with plans to restore, use and someday sell it. At the time, it had mismatched parts, a broken engine and a black paint job. But four years later, red leather interior, white paint and a purring engine have brought the car back to life.</p>
    <p>Orlie finished the restoration project four months ago. But instead of finally using his prized possession, the 45-year-old recently sold it.</p>
    <p>That’s because he can barely afford his family’s $1,832.73 monthly health insurance premiums.</p>
    <p>“Right now, having cash in the bank is much more important than having a car in the garage,” Orlie said.</p>

    <p>The Arlington native needs health insurance. His right leg was amputated when he was 26 after having cancer as a teenager. His prosthesis, which needs to be replaced every three years and can require sudden maintenance, would cost $60,000 without insurance.</p>
    <p>Orlie has worked in the cell tower real estate business since 2005. Over the years, he wanted to work for himself in the same profession but instead had to work for companies that provided health insurance for his pre-existing condition. </p>
    <p>The Affordable Care Act was supposed to solve that problem. Orlie quit his job and started his own business in April 2015.</p>
    <p>Last year, he and his wife found their first ACA plan. Along with Orlie’s condition, two of their three children have pre-existing conditions, so they wanted a plan with good prescription coverage, as well as good hospitals.</p>
    <p>They settled on a startup called Oscar. With a subsidy, their monthly premiums were $660. It was perfect.</p>
    <p>“But I knew it was too good to be true,” Orlie said.</p>
    <p>Oscar was a new model for health insurance that launched in New York in 2013. It expanded to Texas in 2016 but stopped offering plans in North Texas one year later. Nothing else on the marketplace covered the family’s medical needs.</p>

      <h6>Tell us your story</h6>
      <p>Reporters from <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> want to learn how the Trump administration’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act affects Texans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelaLCa4rreSjRXYYsCabeAcPOTMzFhSrykX_Z_GWD5YRRROw/viewform" target="_blank">We need your help.</a></p>

    <p>Now, they’re paying nearly three times as much for a private plan and debate at month’s end which they should pay first: their health insurance or mortgage, which are nearly the same.</p>
    <p>“There’s just this enormous weight on me right now. It is very, very stressful. I can feel that it affects my marriage,” Orlie said. “I don’t look forward to the end of the month when I know that next payment is coming up on the first.”</p>
    <p>Orlie sold the Porsche for $51,180. That will help — for now.</p>
    <p>He and his wife have set a timeline. If his business isn’t making enough money by the end of May, one of them will find a part-time job. They’ve discussed possibilities like barista or security guard.</p>
    <p>Orlie thinks the reason his insurance is so expensive is the same reason he originally benefited: the pre-existing condition clause. With too many people who need insurance buying in, and too many healthy people opting out, insurance companies are increasing prices.</p>
    <p>That’s one reason why he voted for Donald Trump: the promise to repeal and replace. He wants to once again be able to save and put money aside, and not spend so much on health care.</p>
    <p>Orlie thought Trump as president would fix the problem immediately. Now, he’s not sure.</p>
    <p>“I’m starting to think that there ain’t no relief coming. Prices may even go up next year,” Orlie said. “If it goes up next year, what the heck? What are we going to do?”</p>
